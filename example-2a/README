Example 2

Example 2 is a simple command line version of the DAB software. The
input device is fixed, depending on a setting in the CMakeLists.txt
file. The output is either to the soundcard (default) or to a file
(-O option).

Other than example 1, it binds directly to the functionality implementing
the DAB decoding.

All callbacks are defined, most of them with an empty body.

See the file main.cpp for the command line options

Feel free to improve the program

Points to note:

bytesOut is a new callback function, a function that is called
from the tdc handler (and later may be from others as well)

The data parameter is a packet with a 4 byte header
byte 0 is 0xFF
byte 1 is 0x00
byte 2 is 0xFF
byte 3 is 0x00
byte 4 is the high byte of the 16 bit size
byte 5 is the low  byte of the 16 bit size
byte 6 is 0x00
byte 7 is 0 for packet type 0, 0xFF for packet type 1

Note that the lenngth is the length of the data part, so not taking the
header into account

The bytesOut function puts the data into a simple TCP server that can be 
read from port 8888 (depending on the configuration).
